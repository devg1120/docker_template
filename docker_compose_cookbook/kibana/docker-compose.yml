      #XPACK_SECURITY_COOKIENAME: sid
      
      # An arbitrary string of 32 characters or more that is used to encrypt credentials in a cookie. It is crucial
      # that this key is not exposed to users of Kibana. By default, a value is automatically generated in memory. If
      # you use that default behavior, all sessions are invalidated when Kibana restarts.
      #XPACK_SECURITY_ENCRYPTIONKEY: 
      
      # Sets the secure flag of the session cookie. The default value is false. It is set to true if
      # server.ssl.certificate and server.ssl.key are set. Set this to true if SSL is configured outside of Kibana (for
      # example, you are routing requests through a load balancer or proxy).
      #XPACK_SECURITY_SECURECOOKIES: 'false'
      
      # Sets the session duration (in milliseconds). By default, sessions stay active until the browser is closed. When

      ### X-Pack Machine Learning

      # Set to true (default) to enable machine learning. If set to false in kibana.yml, the machine learning icon is
      # hidden in this Kibana instance. If xpack.ml.enabled is set to true in elasticsearch.yml, however, you can still

      ### X-Pack Reporting
 
      # Set to false to disable X-Pack reporting.
      #XPACK_REPORTING_ENABLED: 'true'

      # Set to any text string. By default, Kibana will generate a random key when it starts, which will cause pending
      # reports to fail after restart. Configure this setting to preserve the same key across multiple restarts and
      # multiple instances of Kibana.
      #XPACK_REPORTING_ENCRYPTIONKEY:

      # day, and hour. Defaults to week.
      #XPACK_REPORTING_QUEUE_INDEXINTERVAL: week

      # Set to true (default) to enable the Kibana instance to to poll the index for pending jobs and claim them for
      # execution. Setting this to false allows the Kibana instance to only add new jobs to the reporting queue, list
      # jobs, and provide the downloads to completed report through the UI.
      #XPACK_REPORTING_QUEUE_POLLENABLED: 'true'

      # Specifies the number of milliseconds that idle workers wait between polling the index for pending jobs.
      # Defaults to 3000 (3 seconds).
      #XPACK_REPORTING_QUEUE_POLLINTERVAL: 3000

      # How long each worker has to produce a report. If your machine is slow or under heavy load, you might need to
      # increase this timeout. Specified in milliseconds. Defaults to 120000 (two minutes).
      #XPACK_REPORTING_QUEUE_TIMEOUT: 120000

      # When visualizations are not evented, this is the amount of time before taking a screenshot. All visualizations
      # that ship with Kibana are evented, so this setting should not have much effect. If you are seeing empty images
      # instead of visualizations, try increasing this value. Defaults to 3000 (3 seconds).
      #XPACK_REPORTING_CAPTURE_LOADDELAY: 3000

      # The uri for the proxy server. Providing the username and password for the proxy server via the uri is not
      # supported.
      #XPACK_REPORTING_CAPTURE_BROWSER_CHROMIUM_PROXY_SERVER: 

      # An array of hosts that should not go through the proxy server and should use a direct connection instead.

      #XPACK_REPORTING_CAPTURE_BROWSER_CHROMIUM_PROXY_BYPASS: 

      # The maximum size of a CSV file before being truncated. This setting exists to prevent large exports from
      # causing performance and storage issues. Defaults to 10485760 (10mB)
      #XPACK_REPORTING_CSV_MAXSIZEBYTES: 10485760

      # Reporting uses a weekly index in Elasticsearch to store the reporting job and the report content. The index is
      # automatically created if it does not already exist. Configure this to a unique value, beginning with
      # .reporting-, for every Kibana instance that has a unique kibana.index setting. Defaults to .reporting
      #XPACK_REPORTING_INDEX: '.reporting'

      # The maximum amount of Spaces that can be used with this instance of Kibana. Some operations in Kibana return
      # all spaces using a single _search from Elasticsearch, so this must be set lower than the
      # index.max_result_window in Elasticsearch. Defaults to 1000.
      #XPACK_SPACES_MAXSPACES: 1000
