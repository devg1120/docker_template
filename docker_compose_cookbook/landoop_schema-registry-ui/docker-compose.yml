  schema-registry-ui:
    image: landoop/schema-registry-ui:latest
    container_name: schema-registry-ui
    restart: unless-stopped
    network_mode: bridge
    ports:
      - 8000:8000/tcp
    environment:
      SCHEMAREGISTRY_URL: 'http://192.0.2.11:8081'
      
      # The port number to use for schema-registry-ui. The default is 8000. Usually the main reason for using this is
      # when you run the container with --net=host, where you can't use docker's publish flag (-p HOST_PORT:8000).
      #PORT: 8000

      # Support for global compatibility level configuration (i.e change the default compatibility level of your schema
      # registry).
      ALLOW_GLOBAL: 1
      
      # Support for transitive compatibility levels (Schema Registry version 3.1.1 or better).
      ALLOW_TRANSITIVE: 1
      
      # Support for Schema deletion (Schema Registry version 3.3.0 or better).
      ALLOW_DELETION: 1
      
      # Support for readonly mode (overwrites settings for global compatibility configuration and schema deletion).
      READONLY_MODE: 0

      # If you have CORS issues or want to pass through firewalls and maybe share your server, add the PROXY option.
      # Run the container with -e PROXY=true and Caddy server will proxy the traffic to Schema Registry.
      # IMPORTANT: When proxying, for the SCHEMAREGISTRY_URL you have to use an IP address or a domain that can be
      # resolved to it. You can't use localhost even if you serve Schema Registry from your localhost. The reason for
      # this is that a docker container has its own network, so your localhost is different from the container's
      # localhost. As an example, if you are in your home network and have an IP address of 192.168.5.65 and run Schema
      # Registry from your computer, instead of http://127.0.1:8082 you must use http://192.168.5.65:8082.
      PROXY: 'true'

      # If your Schema Registry uses self-signed SSL certificates, you can use the PROXY_SKIP_VERIFY=true environment
      # variable to instruct the proxy to not verify the backend TLS certificate.
      #PROXY_SKIP_VERIFY: 'true'

      # The webserver that powers the image is Caddy. Via this variable you can add options that will be appended to
      # its configuration (Caddyfile). Variables than span multiple lines are supported.
      #
      # As an example, you can set Caddy to not apply timeouts via:
      #   -e "CADDY_OPTIONS=timeouts none"
      # Or you can set basic authentication via:
      #   -e "CADDY_OPTIONS=basicauth / [USER] [PASS]"
      #CADDY_OPTIONS: '[]'

      # When proxying Schema Registry, enabling this option will set the Schema Registry endpoint in the UI as a
      # relative URL. This can help when running Schema Registry UI under a subpath of your server
      # (e.g http://url:8000/sr-ui instead of http://url:8000/).
      # RELATIVE_PROXY_URL: 'false'
